# at-summer-intern2019
This repository is prepared for the AT team of ARG summer intern. The materials include NodeMCU, Haptic device design, TrailNet and Guiding robot v1

### 01-play-with-NodeMCU
This material will indroduce NodeMCU, and its communication method with ROS. We will refer concept of ROS topic through arduino code examples. Here 's the [Google document link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wuj0i9Z-HVB7Gg2elkC2kIU19ypu7MpqO-8UQTSBxZQ/edit?usp=sharing)
- The example 1 will let NodeMCU connect to ROS system via Wi-Fi, and implement both 1 publisher and 1 subscriber on NodeMCU.
- The example 2 will introduce TF and implement fake /odom to /base_link transform. The fake robot with try to drive in circle.
